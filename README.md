This software is pre-alpha. It's not useful or ready yet.

## Introduction

`kafka-cli` is a command line tool written for Kafka. It uses [segmentio/kafka-go](https://github.com/segmentio/kafka-go).

## Motivation

I wanted to learn `segmentio/kafka-go` and also was tired of using the Java CLI tools provided with Kafka.
